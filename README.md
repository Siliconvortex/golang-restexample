This is a follow-up on a comment I posted on a youtube tutorial (https://www.youtube.com/watch?v=hRR-Zy1H-Yo).

I just couldn't swallow the fact that the OP copied/pasted code between the server/client...so, this is an attempt to abstract those data structures into something useable/sharable between the two (the "produce" package).

FULL DISCLAIMER: I'm not a card carrying gopher just yet.

# TODO

- testing
- command line arguments with default (for port # details)
